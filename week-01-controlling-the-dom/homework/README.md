# Week 1 Homework

The homeworks and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.

Please refer to the [Instructions for Submitting Homework](/how-tos/homework-submission.md).

## Day 1

1. Make sure you've made a Pull Request on the [homework repo](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/homework).  You should have created a new directory with your github username and submitted this *change* as a pull-request during class this afternoon.  You may want to review those instructions.

2. Follow the instructions on [github.com/sf-wdi-25/command-line-mystery](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/command-line-mystery) to solve the command-line mysteries and submit your solution.md as a pull-request to the **command line mystery** repository.  (not the homework repository)  Don't worry if you can't complete everything.  If you need help, work together and make use of the TAs.
