# homework repository setup

We will keep our class notes in this repository.  Homework, however, will be submitted to another repo as *pull-requests*.

Pull-requests are very common in our field and are used extensively by the open-source community.  Pull-requests are, literally a *request to pull code from one entity's repository to another's*.  More generally, they are a way of sharing or contributing your improvements or changes to a body of code, with the rest of the community.

We'll be using them in a slightly different way; as a way for us to review your homework submissions.  

Let's head over to the [Homework repository](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/homework) and get setup.

Also take some time to review the [homework submission instructions](/how-tos/homework-submission.md).  Follow these instructions to submit most homework assignments.
