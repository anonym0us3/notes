# Setting up your Homework Repository

Our class schedule, lecture notes, and homework assignments live in the repository you are currently viewing (`github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes`). To submit your homework, you will be submitting *pull-requests* with your changes, from your personal homework repo (`github.com/your-github-username/homework`) to the main homework repo (`github.com/sf-wdi-25/homework`).

Pull-requests are very common in our field and are used extensively by the open-source community.  Pull-requests are, literally a *request to pull code from one entity's repository to another's*.  More generally, they are a way of sharing or contributing your improvements or changes to a body of code, with the rest of the community.

We'll be using them in a slightly different way: as a way for us to review your homework submissions.  

1. To get started, we need you to setup your personal homework repo. Let's head over to the [Homework repository](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/homework) and follow the instructions there.

2. When you're finished, take some time to review the [homework submission instructions](/how-tos/homework-submission.md).  You'll need to follow these instructions to submit most homework assignments.
