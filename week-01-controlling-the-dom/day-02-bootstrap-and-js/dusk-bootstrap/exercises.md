## Exercises - Bootstrap & Grid

#### Modular, class-based CSS styles
Play with the following codepen: [class-based css](http://codepen.io/nathanallen/pen/qOvBzr?editors=110)

1. All `p` tags should have a font size of 14px.
2. Instructions should have a light-grey background and 10px of padding.
3. `.typewriter` should be a monospace font.
4. `.angry` should have red font, underlined words, and be in all caps.
5. `.box` should have a thin border all around it.
6. `.pink` should turn either the font or the background pink.
7. Can you combine all the styles, all at once, on the same element? Are there any conflicts?
8. Stretch: DIY Grid
    - `.half` - Can you create a style called `.half` that causes an element to fill (only) half of the screen?
    - Can you get `.half` elements to line up side-by-side?
    - Bonus: does it still work if you nest a `.half` elment inside of a `.half` element?

#### Fiddling with the Grid
Play with the following codepen: [bootstrap-grid-demo](http://codepen.io/nathanallen/pen/XmOBdL?editors=110)

1. What happens when you grab the corner of your browser and resize/reflow the browser window?
2. What is a breakpoint? When does the "break" happen? How many pixels is that?
3. Which screen-size are we targeting?
4. What would happen if we put a row of columns _inside_ of a column!? Can the grid even handle that? Try it [here](http://codepen.io/nathanallen/pen/gaqVOj?editors=110)
5. How would you stop the columns in the `.col-md-6` row from "stacking" on a mobile phone?
6. Can you recreate the standard two-column layout?
    - roughly 2/3rd width for the main content
    - roughly 1/3rd width for the sidebar
    - a tiny 1/12th offset between the main content and the sidebar
