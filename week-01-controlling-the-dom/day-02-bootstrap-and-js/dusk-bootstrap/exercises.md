## Exercises - Bootstrap & Grid

#### Fiddling with the Grid
Play with the following codepen: [bootstrap-grid-demo](http://codepen.io/nathanallen/pen/XmOBdL?editors=110)

1. What happens when you grab the corner of your browser and resize/reflow the browser window?
2. What is a breakpoint? When does the "break" happen? How many pixels is that?
3. Which screen-size are we targeting?
4. What would happen if we put a row of columns _inside_ of a column!? Can the grid even handle that? Try it [here](http://codepen.io/nathanallen/pen/gaqVOj?editors=110)
5. How would you stop the columns in the `.col-md-6` row from "stacking" on a mobile phone?
6. Can you recreate the standard two-column layout?
    - roughly 2/3rd width for the main content
    - roughly 1/3rd width for the sidebar
    - a tiny 1/12th offset between the main content and the sidebar
