| Objectives |
| :---- |
| DELETE content you created by accident. |
| Handle errors returned from REST APIs. |
| Explain the basic list of HTTP verbs. |

## Practice CR

Last module you created a <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/ajax-book-app/tree/master" target="_blank">small website</a> capable of `POST`ing and `GET`ting data from a REST API. Do you have it all setup?

Let's get into groups and checkout where everyone is. It's important we have this working in order to continue so if you've fallen behind let's work as a team and get everyone setup.

In order to continue you'll need.

1. An `index.html` page to open in a browser.
  * It must include jQuery (we'll use it to make requests).
  * There must be a form which can create a book.
  * We must be able to get a list of books.

1. <details>
  <summary>A `main.js` file with the body surrounded by a function which is called on `document`'s ready event.</summary>
  ```js
  $(document).ready(function () {
    // All your function code!
    // Why do you do this?
  });
  ```
</details>

## Intro to why update/delete

[![Oooops](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1329385/10920179/bc90396a-8223-11e5-8080-6eb41d7db3ed.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)

We've created a few books and seen a list of all the books so we're done. What else could we possibly need?

Well I've created a book with a title of "Hankleberry Finn" on accident. It was supposed to be "Huckleberry Finn" and now my library of books is ruined.

In order to fix this we'll `DELETE` this book and create a new one with the proper name.

## Delete an item

In order to `DELETE` an item we'll need to know the ID of the item we're going to `DELETE`.

This is similar to doing a `GET` on a book, we needed an ID of a book in the list but instead of returning the book we're going to destroy it.

```js
$.ajax({
  method: "DELETE",
  url: "https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books/563950249f89f21100e7c2ff",
  success: function (data) {
    console.log("DESTROYED!");
  }
});
```

<details>
  <summary>Does `DELETE` remove something forever?</summary>
  It depends, it will if the people who developed the server set it up that way.
</details>

## Delete a non-existent item

A problem which comes up often for me is that I forget the ID. It's hard to remember an ID like `563950249f89f21100e7c2ff`.

What should happen when I try to `DELETE` something which doesn't exist?

```js
$.ajax({
  method: "DELETE",
  url: "https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books/53110lolbroken",
  success: function (data) {
    console.log("DESTROYED!");
  },
  error: function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});
```

<details>
  <summary>Will all APIs raise an error if the item doesn't exist?</summary>
  IT DEPENDS! Some APIs are worse than those geocities websites from the '90s. If they don't raise an error, then you'll need to find a workaround.
</details>

## Update and show changes

If we need to make some changes we'll `POST` to the same endpoint in order to `UPDATE` the attributes we need to change.

```js
$.ajax({
  method: "PUT",
  url: "https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books/563950249f89f21100e7c2ff",
  data: {
    title: "Huckleberry Finn",
    author: "Mark Twain",
    image: "https://media.giphy.com/media/xDRq2yipbOWDC/giphy.gif"
  },
  success: function (data) {
    console.log("UPDATED!");
  }
});
```

<details>
  <summary>What if I only want to change one attribute?</summary>
  That is a partial update and you use a `PATCH` HTTP verb. It accepts a partial object in the update.
</details>

## Update a non-existent item

```js
$.ajax({
  method: "PUT",
  url: "https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books/563950249f89f21100e7c2ff/",
  data: {
    title: "Huckleberry Finn",
    author: "Mark Twain",
    image: "https://media.giphy.com/media/xDRq2yipbOWDC/giphy.gif"
  },
  success: function (data) {
    console.log("UPDATED!");
  },
  error: function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});
```

## Challenges

Research each question for a few minutes then we'll get together again in groups and discuss what we've found. You must have at least one website URL which can be used as reference.

1. Why do we use REST?
1. What is REST?
1. What is an alternative to REST?
1. What are HTTP Error codes?
1. Why are HTTP Error codes used?
