# Week 1 Homework

The homework assignments and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.

Please refer to the [Instructions for Submitting Homework](/how-tos/homework-submission.md).


## Day 1

1. Browse the Docs: [Mongoose Model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model), [MongoDB CRUD](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/crud/).
2. Your goal is to add mongoose to your Personal API (from the weekend lab):
    * **DO NOT PUSH TO HEROKU** (it will break all the things)
    * First, we recommend you debug anything that's broken, and commit any pending changes.
    * Next, we recommend you create a new `branch` for version #2 of your app:

        ```bash
            git checkout -b mongodb_integration
        ```
    * Make sure that when you push your changes, you push to (and from) the correct branch!

        ```bash
            git branch      # mongodb_integration
            git push origin mongodb_integration
        ```
    * Can you modify your CRUD routes to use mongoose? (Take a close look at the morning lab!)

Please use any remaining time to complete and review the exercises from dawn & dusk.
