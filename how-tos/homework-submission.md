#Instructions for Submitting Homework

## Submitting Dawn/Dusk Exercises

Please submit your solutions to **dawn/dusk exercises** using your homework repo.

- Copy/paste your solutions into your homework repo (e.g. john-doe/week-01/day-01/solutions.md)
- Follow the instructions below for *Creating Pull Requests*.

## Submitting Lab Work
Unlike dawn/dusk exercises, *labs* are projects you started in class that you had to fork and clone. These require a slightly different submission flow:

- When you begin a lab, you must remember to first `fork` the lab! (Just click the `fork` button).
- Next, `git clone` your fork of the lab so that you can work on it locally (on your computer).
- Congrats! You're ready to tackle the lab!


### Creating Pull Requests
When you're ready to submit your homework (and it's okay if you only have a partial solution, we still want to see it!), you need to push your changes to github and create a pull request:

- First, `git commit` your changes
- Next, `git push` your updates to your fork of the homework repo on github.
- Finally, go to your homework repo on github and submit a *pull request (PR)* using the format described below.
