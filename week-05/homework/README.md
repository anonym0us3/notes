# Week 5 Homework

## Holiday Break Homework

1. Ruby Reading
2. [Ruby Method Drills](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/ruby_method_drills) with tests!
3. Bonus: Nathan's made a fun little [Text Adventure](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/text_adventure) lab which we'd like you to experiment with!

Please use any remaining time to review exercises/drills from the week! And don't forget to sleep!
