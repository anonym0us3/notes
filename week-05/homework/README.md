# Week 5 Homework

## Holiday Break Homework

Your goal over break is to:
* Review all the things!
* Refactor Project 1 -- or even better, build it again from scratch!
* Get comfy with the Ruby Language

1. Ruby Reading
2. [Ruby Method Drills](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/ruby_method_drills) with tests!
3. Optional: Nathan's made a fun little [Text Adventure](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/text_adventure) lab, which we'd like you to experiment with!

Please use any remaining time to review exercises/drills from the past 5 weeks! And don't forget to eat, sleep, and enjoy the break!
