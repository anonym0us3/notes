# Week 5 Homework

## Holiday Homework

1. Work through all of [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com): Ruby Primer.  For a quick reference/simple-intro you could read [Code Like This](http://codelikethis.com/lessons/learn_to_code) first, before the primer.  If you have spare-time also tackle the "Ruby Ascent" lessons.
2. A Quick 'Rosetta Stone' of Javascript and Ruby methods can be found [here](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes/tree/master/week-01-controlling-the-dom/day-03-js/dawn-functions) and [here](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes/blob/break-hmwk/week-05/homework/ruby-methods.md).   These are direct translations from the Javascript functions we learned in week 1 with their Ruby counterparts (plus some extra). Familiarize yourself with the differences and similarities.  To really get comfortable with Ruby, try to translate the Javascript challenges [here](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes/blob/master/week-01-controlling-the-dom/day-03-js/dawn-functions/exercises.md) to Ruby.  
2. [Ruby Method Drills](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/ruby_method_drills) with tests!
3. Optional: Nathan's made a fun little [Text Adventure](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/text_adventure) lab, which we'd like you to experiment with!
4. Recommended: Project 1 Refactor!
    * Create and resolve at least [2 Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
    * Refactor existing code & pay down some "technical debt"
    * Build it again from scratch (highly recommended).

Please use any remaining time to review exercises/drills from the past 5 weeks! And don't forget to eat, sleep, and enjoy the break!
