# Week 5 Homework

## Holiday Homework

1. Work through all of Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer](https://rubymonk.com).
    * If that's too hard, try [Code Like This](http://codelikethis.com/lessons/learn_to_code) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dji9ALCgfpM) first! 
    * If that's too easy, move on to Ruby Monk's [Ruby Primer Ascent](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent).
2. Translate [these Javascript challenges](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes/blob/master/week-05/homework/ruby-method-challenges.md) that we have gone over previously into Ruby.
    * Justin has put together a nice 'Rosetta Stone' of [Javascript](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/notes/tree/master/week-01-controlling-the-dom/day-03-js/dawn-functions) vs. [Ruby](ruby-methods.md). Take a look at it!
2. Required: [Ruby Method Drills](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/ruby_method_drills) with tests!
3. Optional: Nathan's made a fun little [Text Adventure](https://github.com/sf-wdi-25/text_adventure) lab, which he'd like you to experiment with!
4. Recommended: Project 1 Refactor!
    * Resolve at least [2 Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
    * Refactor existing code & pay down some "technical debt"
    * Build it again from scratch (highly recommended).

Please use any remaining time to review exercises/drills from the past 5 weeks (tunely, personal api, mongo tv drills, geoquakes, giffaw...)! And don't forget to eat, sleep, and enjoy the break!
